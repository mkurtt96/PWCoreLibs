# üß± PW.CoreLibs

**PW.CoreLibs** is the foundational framework layer used across all PW modules.  
It provides essential shared types, data containers, interfaces, logging utilities, input extensions, and core runtime helpers for Unreal Engine 5 projects.

These libraries form the base upon which systems such as **PW.GAS**, **PW.Ability**, and **PW.Teams** are built.

## üß© Overview

PW.CoreLibs establishes a **modular, dependency-safe foundation** with minimal coupling and full C++ / Blueprint integration.

- **PWSharedTypes**
  - Defines core structs and lightweight data containers such as `MultiDataArray` and `SpellParams`.
  - Shared type layer for ability and gameplay data exchange.
- **PWContracts**
  - Provides gameplay contracts and interfaces such as `IDamageable`, `IEffectable`, and `IEffectReceiverInterface`.
  - Enables consistent communication between systems.
- **PWLogging**
  - Extensible log system with channels, filters, and debug macros.
  - Blueprint-safe logging through unified interfaces.
- **PWFoundation**
  - Contains the **WTM (PW Timer Manager)** for global timer handling and utility macros.
  - Includes various foundation-level utilities for runtime tasks and identifiers.
- **PWInput**
  - Enhanced input routing and component logic.
  - Built to work with Unreal‚Äôs Enhanced Input System while adding dynamic context management.
